# Search-In-A-Sorted-Matrix
 This is very logical question for building logic as it follows a stair-case aproach along with binary and linear search arguments.
 In this query basically we start our loop from the top-right corner and move till left-bottom.If we found our key greater than the 
present index then we will increment row wise otherwise column wise like stairs.
